# Data Analytics Basics ðŸ“Š

## 1. Foundations of Data Analysis
- **Data Analysis Definition**: Data analysis is a process of modelling, analyzing, and interpreting data to
extract insights.
- **Data lifecycle**: Use case > Data collection > Storage > Processing > Analysis > Visualization > Communication
- **Types of analytics**: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive
- **Data roles**: Data Analyst, BI Analyst, Data Scientist, Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer

## 2. Data Sources
- Databases, spreadsheets, APIs, streaming data
- Structured, Semi-structured, Unstructured data
- Data formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet
- Keys & relationships:
  - **Primary**: a unique identifier for each record in a table.
  - **Foreign keys**: a field in a table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.
  - 1â€“1, 1â€“Many, Manyâ€“Many

## 3. Data Preparation (Cleaning & Transformation)
- Handling missing values
- Handling duplicates
- Data types & conversions
- Outlier basics
- Normalization vs Standardization
- Text cleanup (trim spaces, case formatting, remove symbols)

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std, percentiles)
- Distributions & variability
- Correlations
- Segmentation

## 5. Business Understanding & Metrics
- KPIs
- Essential business metrics (marketing):
  - Conversion rate
  - Retention rate
  - Growth metrics
  - Cohorts & segmentation
 
## 6. Data Modelling Concepts
- Star schema: fact vs dimension tables
- Granularity
- Slowly changing dimensions (basic awareness)
- Benefits of data modelling (performance, reusability)

## 7. Data Visualisation & Insight Communication
- Chart selection best practices
- Storytelling with data
- Dashboards & Reports

## 8. Documentation & Reproducibility
- Meta data
- Code / Queries / Workflows documentation
- Version control basics
- Communicating assumptions, limitations, and data decisions

**`Data Mining vs Data Profiling:`**

| Aspect            | **Data Mining**                                                     | **Data Profiling**                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**       | Extract hidden patterns, correlations, and insights from data       | Understand data quality, structure, and anomalies               |
| **Focus**         | Analytics, prediction, and decision support                         | Assessing data fitness for use before analytics                 |
| **Techniques**    | Machine learning, statistical modelling, clustering, classification | Completeness checks, data type validation, frequency analysis   |
| **Output**        | Trends, predictive models, actionable insights                      | Data quality metrics, metadata summaries                        |
| **Project Stage** | Typically after data preparation                                    | Early phase of data pipeline (before cleansing/transformation)  |
| **Key Benefit**   | Drives strategic and operational decisions                          | Reduces errors and improves reliability of downstream analytics |

#### `Data Normalization:`
The process of structuring data to reduce redundancy and improve integrityâ€”typically by organizing it into related tables and enforcing rules (normal forms) so that each data point is stored once and updated consistently.

#### `Data Warehouse:`
A large centralized repository of data used for reporting and analysis, combining and organizing data from different sources for efficient querying and reporting.

#### `Role of a Data Analyst:`
Collects, processes, and analyzes data to identify trends, patterns and make informed decisions.

#### `Handling Large Datasets:`
Requires the use of efficient data storage and processing techniques such as;
- SQL databases
- Parallel computing: running multiple computations at the same time across multiple processors, rather than sequentially on a single one.
- Cloud-based solutions
- Code optimization (performance tuning)

#### `Latest Trends and Developemts Updates:`
- Blogs
- Podcasts
- Online courses
- Conferences
- Industry publications

#### `Data Privacy and Security Concerns:`
- Data protection regulations
- Anonymizing sensitive data
- Secure data storage and transfer methods
- Access controls
