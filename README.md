# Data Analytics Overview ðŸ“Š

## 1. Foundations of Data Analysis
- **Data Analysis Definition**: Data analysis is a process of modelling, analyzing, and interpreting data to
extract insights.
- **Data roles**: Data Analyst, BI Analyst, Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, etc. A `Data Analyst` collects, processes, and analyzes data to identify trends, patterns and make informed decisions.
  
- **Data lifecycle**: Use case > Data collection > Storage > Processing > Analysis > Visualization > Communication
- **Types of analytics**:

  - `Descriptive Analysis:` What happened?
      > `Example:` A skincare brand sees 15,000 people clicked their Instagram ad last week, but only 500 purchased.
  
  - `Diagnostic Analysis:` Why did it happen?
      > `Example:` Analysis shows that shipping costs made many customers abandon their carts at checkout.

  - `Predictive Analysis:` What will likely happen?
      > `Example:` If nothing changes, the model forecasts cart drop-offs will keep increasing as shipping prices rise.

  - `Prescriptive Analysis:` What should we do?
      > `Example:` The system recommends offering free shipping above $40 to increase checkout conversions.

  - `Exploratory Analysis:` What hidden opportunities exist?
      > `Example:` Data reveals customers who buy face cleansers often buy serums within a week, suggesting a personalised follow-up email can boost revenue.

## 2. Data Sources
- Databases, spreadsheets, APIs, streaming data, SaaS applications (Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, etc.)
- Structured, Semi-structured, Unstructured data
- Data formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet
- Keys & relationships:
  - **Primary**: a unique identifier for each record in a table.
  - **Foreign keys**: a field in a table that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.
  - 1â€“1, 1â€“Many, Manyâ€“Many

## 3. Data Preparation (Cleaning & Transformation)
- Duplicates
- Missing Values
- Data Types
- Data Formats
- Invalid Data
- Irrelevant Data
- Special Characters
- Outliers (statistical analysis)
- Normalization vs Standardization (model building)

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std, percentiles)
- Distributions & variability
- Correlations
- Segmentation
  - Demographic (age, gender, income level, education, occupation, marital status)
  - Geographic (country, state, city, climate zones, urban vs rural, population density)
  - Psychographic (values & beliefs, interests/attitudes)
  - Behavioural (recency, frequency, monetary-RFM)
An unsupervised machine learning technique, `K-Means Clustering`, groups customers based on similarity in behaviour (advanced RFM analysis)
- Market basket analysis
- Cohort analysis

## 5. Business Understanding & Metrics
- KPIs
- Essential business metrics (marketing):
  - Conversion rate
  - Retention rate
  - Growth metrics
  - Cohorts & segmentation
 
## 6. Data Modelling Concepts
- Star schema: fact vs dimension tables
- Granularity
- Slowly changing dimensions (basic awareness)
- Benefits of data modelling (performance, reusability)

## 7. Data Visualisation & Insight Communication
- Chart selection best practices
- Storytelling with data
- Dashboards & Reports

## 8. Documentation & Reproducibility
- Meta data
- Code / Queries / Workflows documentation
- Version control basics
- Communicating assumptions, limitations, and data decisions

### Miscellaneous

**`Data Mining vs Data Profiling:`**

| Aspect            | **Data Mining**                                                     | **Data Profiling**                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**       | Extract hidden patterns, correlations, and insights from data       | Understand data quality, structure, and anomalies               |
| **Focus**         | Analytics, prediction, and decision support                         | Assessing data fitness for use before analytics                 |
| **Techniques**    | Machine learning, statistical modelling, clustering, classification | Completeness checks, data type validation, frequency analysis   |
| **Output**        | Trends, predictive models, actionable insights                      | Data quality metrics, metadata summaries                        |
| **Project Stage** | Typically after data preparation                                    | Early phase of data pipeline (before cleansing/transformation)  |
| **Key Benefit**   | Drives strategic and operational decisions                          | Reduces errors and improves reliability of downstream analytics |

#### `Data Normalization:`
The process of structuring data to reduce redundancy and improve integrityâ€”typically by organizing it into related tables and enforcing rules (normal forms) so that each data point is stored once and updated consistently.

#### `Data Warehouse:`
A large centralized repository of data used for reporting and analysis, combining and organizing data from different sources for efficient querying and reporting.

#### `Handling Large Datasets:`
Requires the use of efficient data storage and processing techniques such as;
- SQL databases
- Parallel computing: running multiple computations at the same time across multiple processors, rather than sequentially on a single one.
- Cloud-based solutions
- Code optimization (performance tuning)

#### `Latest Trends and Developemts Updates:`
- Blogs
- Podcasts
- Online courses
- Conferences
- Industry publications

#### `Data Privacy and Security Concerns:`
- Data protection regulations
- Anonymizing sensitive data
- Secure data storage and transfer methods
- Access controls
